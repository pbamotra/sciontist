title: Day 1 @ Autodesk, Pycon 2016, pycontracts, gevent
---
I officially started working at Autodesk Inc. at their ![location pin image](images/location-pin.png) [Landmark](http://www.autodesk.com/gallery/overview) office in San Francisco today. Believe me when I say that it's among the most beautiful offices out there. The day was fun as we were walked through the company's concrete mission - Imagine, Design, Create. Before coming here, I've had just this notion of relating Autodesk to AutoCAD, but certainly it is much more than that. I would like you to see the video below.

Last night, I discovered that the Pycon 2016 [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0zlRQ1qgIk) are up on Youtube and has some really exciting talks. I personally liked the following talks: -

1. Kalman Filters for non-rocket science by Elizabeth Ramirez
2. Python Epiphanies by Stuart Williams (Highly recommended for budding Pythonistas)
3. A tale of concurrency through creativity in Python: Into how gevent works by Kavya Joshi. I have a little exposure to event loop based programming through node.js and having [*gevent*](http://www.gevent.org/contents.html) in Python = Mind blown! Make sure to check this out.  

I stumbled upon the [pycontracts](http://censi.mit.edu/pub/research/201410-pycontracts/201410-pycontracts.pdf) library too. Since Python is dynamic when it comes to *typing*, pycontracts lets you enforce *contracts* on the function arguments and the return values. Result - Clean and robust code.

I've been following Pycon for a while and I was astonished to see that 40% of talks this time were delivered by women in technology. Wow! Kudos to all the ladies!
