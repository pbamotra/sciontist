Python has always been my favorite. Discovering new libraries and its hidden features fascinate me like a five-year old. My experiences with Python till now have been mostly academic. Most of the assignments simply required modules that had no more than 200 lines of code, and that's it. So this summer, I've decided to take my learning to the next level. The spring semester finished on May 10 and I've been reading quite a few books on Python 3 particularly. Today I finished reading the *Functional Python Programming* by Steven Lott and learnt quite a deal about _itertools_ and _functools_ modules. These module come with fancy operations like [starmap](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/itertools.html#itertools.starmap), [tee](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee), [compress](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/itertools.html#itertools.compress), [lru_cache](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) (I'm a fan of this!), and [partial](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html#functools.partial). There's also a special chapter on PyMonad which is intuitively written and left me in awe since this was my first time with monads. The book is certainly not for absolute beginners but does a great justice to people with intermediate experience with Python. There's also a lucid discussion on _multiprocessing_ and _threading_ modules. However, I missed the discussion on _asyncio_ module. Overall the book was really worth the time spent and I would rate it 4.5/5.

Having finished Lott's book, I'm moving on to selectively read topics from *Introducing Python* by Bill Lubanovic on concurrency, networks, and _unittest_ module. The book looks interesting and goes from basic to advanced Python programming. I will post updates on the book in a later writeup.
